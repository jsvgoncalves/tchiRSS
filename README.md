### About TchiRSS

http://lopis.github.io/tchiRSS/

TchiRSS is a web app I create to easily track changes to my RSS feeds without having to rely on other services. It sits on your local or remote PHP Apache server and you can set it as your homepage and, for instance, check when was the last time your manga series released a new chapter.

Tchi is still under development.
