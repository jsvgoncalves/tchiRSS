RSS Timestamp

RRSTS is a tool to easily track changes to rss feeds
without having to rely on thirdparty services. It sits
on your local PHP Apache server and you can set ito your
homepage or something and see little warnings saying
"last update: 3 days ago". 

It's still in early development. Current goals are:
- [ ] SQLite connection to save rss feed links.
- [ ] GUI to add rss link
- [ ] Extracting last release dates from rss xml documents
- [ ] Come up with a "mark as read" feature or "last item read"
because sometimes just "last realese date" is not enough.
