{"name":"TchiRSS","tagline":"","body":"![logo](http://i.imgur.com/zipWZOy.png)\r\n\r\nTchiRSS is a tool to easily track changes to RSS feeds without having to rely on third-party services. It sits on your local or remote PHP Apache server and you can set to your homepage or something and see little warnings saying \"last update: 3 days ago\". \r\n\r\nIt's still in development. Current goals are:\r\n* **[ok]** SQLite connection to save RSS feed links.\r\n* **[ok]** GUI to add RSS link\r\n* **[ok]** Extracting last release dates from RSS XML documents\r\n* **[no]** Come up with a \"mark as read\" feature or \"last item read because sometimes just \"last release date\" is not enough.\r\n* **[no]** Saving images to disk to load them faster\r\n* **[no]** Do something about the slowness of feed fetching. I'll probably move all fetching to JavaScript in the near future and do it only after the DOM is loaded. Plus, I can add reloading animations and such.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* PHP\r\n* Apache (or equivalent)\r\n* SQLite libraries for PHP\r\n* At least 182KB of free disk space\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![screen1](http://i.imgur.com/rFAnBDn.png)\r\n![mobile](http://i.imgur.com/X9lcnen.png)\r\n","google":"UA-41780079-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
